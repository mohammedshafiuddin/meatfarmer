# Progress Summary - Meat Farmer Admin UI

## Recent Changes

### Slot Selection Centralization
- **Moved slot dropdown** from individual pages (Packaging, Delivery, Delivery Sequences) to the Manage Orders hub page
- **Updated navigation** to pass `slotId` as query parameters when navigating to child pages
- **Modified child pages** to read slot selection from URL params using `useLocalSearchParams()`

### UI Cleanup
- **Removed redundant refresh buttons** from Packaging and Delivery pages (drawer refresh button handles this)
- **Removed child pages from drawer navigation** - Packaging, Delivery, and Delivery Sequences are now only accessible through Manage Orders hub
- **Updated drawer layout** to remove individual page entries and keep only Manage Orders

### Delivery Sequences Page Improvements

  - First line: "Order #{readableId} [items list]    â‚¹{totalAmount}"
  - Second line: Address (line1, line2 only)
- **Removed customer name** from display to reduce clutter
- **Streamlined layout** focusing on essential delivery information
